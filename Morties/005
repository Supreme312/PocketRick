```005 - Old Morty

This Morty remembers when this all used to be fields and he could fly his kite freely without the fear of it becoming stuck in a tree.

The in-game description for Old Morty is a reference to the original short story The Real Animated Adventures of Doc and Mharti that later on evolved into the series Rick and Morty. In the short story Mharti gets his kite stuck in a tree, creating a problem to be solved by him and Doc.

Old Morty appears in the game Pocket Mortys. He evolves into Geriatric Morty, and his final evolution is Ancient Morty.
