```001 - Morty

This is your Morty, don't lose him!

Morty is the Morty you start out with in Pocket Mortys. Along with Cronenberg Morty and Morticia, he is different from all the other Mortys because he has no type (Rock, paper or scissors) and has no great advantage/disadvantage over any type. He is also the only Morty that cannot be released.```
